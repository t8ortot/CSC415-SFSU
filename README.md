# Principles of Operating Systems
This is my coursework from my Principles of Operating Systems course I took in Summer 2018 at San Francisco State University.

Projects include:
- Hello World
- File Copier
- Bash Shell
- Thread Race Condition Example
- Producer and Consumer Threads

I am withholding the course ID from this repo to avoid plagiarism from current and future attending students.

Disclaimer: The original repos to these projects were owned and deleted by the facilitating instructor, therefore there are not many commits to show in this repo.
