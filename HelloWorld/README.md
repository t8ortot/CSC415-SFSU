# Hello World

This program was written in the language C in Sublime Text 3.0, checked in JetBrains CLion 2018.1.3, and tested in Ubuntu 16.04's terminal. The program is supposed to print out the sentence "Hello World! This program written by James Clark!!!" into the terminal without using the printf() function in C, and instead use the sprintf() and write() functions.

## Run Instructions
- Once built, you may use the command "./hw" to run the program while in the project's directory in the terminal.
